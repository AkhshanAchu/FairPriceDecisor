## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms
- **Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Enhanced shortest path optimization for multi-constraint routing
- **Capacity-Aware Allocation** - Resource optimization considering vehicle and warehouse capacities  
- **Cost-Effective Mapping** - Warehouse-to-demand zone pairing for minimum transportation costs
- **Dynamic Route Recalculation** - Real-time route adjustments based on traffic and demand changes

### Optimization Strategies
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing cost, time, and resource utilization
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing demand across available warehouses efficiently
- **Underutilization Prevention**: Smart algorithms to minimize empty vehicle trips
- **Demand Prediction**: Historical data analysis for better resource planning
